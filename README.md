Title: Predicting House Prices Using SVM Regression  Overview: In this project, I used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict house prices. The dataset used was the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to create a model that accurately predicts the sale price of a house given various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and neighborhood.  Preprocessing: Before training the SVM model, I performed some preprocessing steps on the data. This included handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and scaling the numerical features.  Model Selection and Training: I chose to use the SVM algorithm as it has been shown to work well with high-dimensional datasets like the one we have. I split the data into training and testing sets and used grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the SVM model. I then trained the model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set using various metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.  Results: The SVM model was able to achieve a good performance on the testing set with an R-squared score around 0.85 I also created visualizations to see the correlation of diffrent variables.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the SVM algorithm can be a powerful tool for predicting house prices given a set of features. With some preprocessing and careful tuning of hyperparameters, we can create a model that achieves good performance.
